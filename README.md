# Log_events

In this challenge you are given a csv file, logs.csv , in which each row represents an ad impression event. uuid is a user ID and ts is the timestamp of the event. This file represents one month of logs from our advertising platform for a subset of UUIDs. You can download logs.csv here: https://amadeus.box.com/s/tt3rn4gzb2i046sgtu84ebmyqg14obag


The repository contains a IPython Notebook ('log_events.ipynb') with sample coded which derives new features from users events and their time 
of occurence. 


You can view the notebooks directly on github, or clone the repository, install dependencies listed in the notebook and play with code locally.
